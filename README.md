# BingeTV movie web application (React + TypeScript + MobX + TailwindCSS)

This is a basic movie application ui with routings and different page including a home, some category pages, sinlge movie details page.

## highlights of the application

Intuitive UI with small but elegant UX features using TailwindCSS, proper flow of data with the help of state management library MobX.


If some more time could have been leveraged, I would add unit tests for all components.
